My project primarily leverages Hadoop and MapReduce for large-scale social media data analytics, but I also incorporate Apache Pig and Scala to enhance data processing efficiency. Apache Pig provides a high-level abstraction for data transformation tasks, allowing us to write scripts in Pig Latin, which are then converted into MapReduce jobs, simplifying complex workflows. Additionally, Scala is used for developing scalable data processing applications, particularly in scenarios where functional programming paradigms improve code efficiency and maintainability. The data is stored in HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), and all computations are executed within a Docker-containerized environment, ensuring portability and scalability. The development is done in IntelliJ IDEA, with the final output packaged as JAR files for execution in the Hadoop cluster.
